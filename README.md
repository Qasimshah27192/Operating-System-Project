The provided code appears to be a C++ program that implements a basic process management system using linked lists. The program includes different states for processes, such as **Ready**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Suspend**, and allows various operations like **Create**, **Destroy**, **Dispatch**, **Suspend**, and **Resume** on the processes.

Here's a summary and walkthrough of how this code works:

**Program Overview**

- **Process Management:** The program supports managing processes by simulating different process states and allowing the user to perform actions like creating, destroying, and transitioning processes between states.
- **FCFS Scheduling:** It includes an implementation of the First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm.
- **Linked List Structure:** Separate linked lists are used for different process states (Ready, Running, Waiting, and Suspend). This allows easy manipulation and movement of processes between states.
- **Menu-Driven Interface:** The program uses a menu-driven approach, where the user can choose actions to perform on the processes based on input.

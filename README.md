The provided code appears to be a C++ program that implements a basic process management system using linked lists. The program includes different states for processes, such as **Ready**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Suspend**, and allows various operations like **Create**, **Destroy**, **Dispatch**, **Suspend**, and **Resume** on the processes.

Here's a summary and walkthrough of how this code works:

**Program Overview**

  - **Process Management:** The program supports managing processes by simulating different process states and allowing the user to perform actions like creating, destroying, and transitioning processes between states.
  - **FCFS Scheduling:** It includes an implementation of the First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm.
  - **Linked List Structure:** Separate linked lists are used for different process states (Ready, Running, Waiting, and Suspend). This allows easy manipulation and movement of processes between states.
  - **Menu-Driven Interface:** The program uses a menu-driven approach, where the user can choose actions to perform on the processes based on input.

**Key Components**

1. **Process Structures:**

  - node is the basic structure representing a process in the system. It contains properties like process_id, AT (Arrival Time), BT (Burst Time), priority, and state.
  - There are also Running, Waiting, and Suspend structures for processes in their respective states.

2. **Linked List Class (linked_list):**

  - The class manages multiple linked lists, each corresponding to a different process state.
  - It provides functions for creating processes, displaying them, and moving them between different states based on operations like Dispatch, Suspend, Resume, and Wakeup.

3. **Operations:**

  - The create_process function adds a new process to the list with its attributes.
  - Functions like Running_s, Suspend_u, Waiting_v move processes between states.
  - fcfs function implements a basic First-Come, First-Serve scheduling algorithm to determine the order of process execution.

4. **User Interface:**

  - The program presents a menu with options to perform various process management operations.
  - Depending on the user's choice, the program performs actions such as creating a process, destroying a process, dispatching a process, and more.

**Example of a Simplified Workflow**

  1. The user creates processes by entering their attributes (Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority).
  2. The user dispatches processes to the Running queue or moves them to other states like Waiting or Suspend.
  3. The program displays the current status of processes and allows further manipulation like resuming suspended processes or performing scheduling algorithms like FCFS.
